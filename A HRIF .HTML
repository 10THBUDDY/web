<h1><CENTER>ART INTEGRATION</CENTER></H1>
<P STYLE="FONT-SIZE:30PX; COLOR:GOLD">Arts integration is related to arts education in schools. Arts education, while 
existing in different forms during the 19th century, gained popularity as part of John Dewey's Progressive Education Theory. 
The first publication that describes a seamless interplay between the arts and other subjects (arts integration) taught in
 American schools was Leon Winslow's The Integrated School Art Program (1939). For the remainder of the 20th century, arts education's
 role in public schools ebbed and flowed with the country's political leanings and financial well-being. `
According to Liora Bresler, during the 1970s and 1980s, two advocates for arts integration emerged: Harry Broudy and Elliot Eisner.
 Broudy advocated for the arts on the basis of strengthening the imagination. 
 Broudy viewed imagination as an essential component of learning that should be cultivated in schools, and he advocated for the integration of 
aesthetic education into all subject matters in his work, Enlightened Cherishing.
 Eisner followed Broudy, citing that the arts were important to varying types of cognition.
 He believed that arts brought about a deeper understanding of the world due to their 
 interactivityâ€”the arts move learning beyond what is written or read </P> 
 <P STYLE="FONT-SIZE:30PX; COLOR:AQUA">Cassandra B. Whyte emphasized the importance of artistic experiences for students to encourage creative 
and independent thought processes that would be important throughout an individual's lifetime.
 The arts helped students with problem solving and decision making and those processing experiences could be adapted in general life situations.
 [2] Whyte advocated including aspects of art education with locus of control identification counseling experiences to help higher education 
 students develop confidence in their unique problem solving abilities in the classroom and in life.
 <BR> Formerly, No Child Left Behind legislation describes arts education as "essential to every child's education," and include
 it as one of the Core Subjects.[4] No Child Left Behind legislation also emphasizes accountability through assessment
 (often taking the form of the standardized test.) While no standardized assessment has been mandated in any of the arts, 
 the need for academic accountability in the arts, as well as in other academic subject areas, has led to increased research 
 on and advocacy of arts integration and its impact on student learning.
<P STYLE="FONT-SIZE:30PX; COLOR:ORANGE">Currently, Common Core and close adaptions of it are changing the way schools approach learning.
 Common Core's approach to art integration is that it enhances education by making learning interesting and fun. With Common Core becoming
 the norm for many school districts through the United States, teachers are integrating art into the classroom now more than ever.
 The rise of popularity in art integration has increased the amount of resources available to include the classroom, making it easier than ever to use art integration in the classroom </P>
